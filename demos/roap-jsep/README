This library uses the Google JS test framework for testing.
Install instructions are found here:

http://code.google.com/p/google-js-test/wiki/Installing

Note on prerequisites:

The libv8 instructions are deficient; do this:
- download v8 source according to instructions
- make library=shared
- sudo cp include/* /usr/include (clobbering libv8-dev if installed)
- sudo chmod a+r /usr/include/v8*
- sudo cp out/x64.release/lib.target/libv8.so /usr/lib
- sudo chmod a+rx /usr/lib/libv8.so

Then you can compile and install gjstest.

To run the tests, run the "run_tests" shell script.
This will also generate the roap_on_jsep_test.html file, which you can load
in your browser to verify that the tests work there too.
